            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
             <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because it gives them hope that it is possible to become smarter by repeated practice. </p>
            <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>For my own benefit, I can improve my intelligence by repeatedly doing activities that are fundamental, such as reading, memorizing and thinking ahead.</p>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity can be increased by learning something new, like a new language or dance, which strengthens the brain.</p>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p> The growth mindset is about our ability to increase our intelligence by putting more effort into things we want to be better in. This mindset is relevant to our success in life as we are able to persevere through hard challenges that others with a fixed mindset might not be able to handle.</p>
             <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
             <p>The idea that we can increase our intelligence really surprised me because I thought that I could no longer become smarter.</p>
             <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
             <p>I will integrate this growth mindset into my learning by always putting more effort into things I donâ€™t fully understand so that I will eventually overcome my difficulties in learning. </p>
