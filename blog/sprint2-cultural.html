                <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
            </em>

            <p>My long term goal is to become a full stack webdeveloper working in NZ. I enjoy designing and creating websites and want to make a living doing this kind of work. </p>

                <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            </em>
            <p>I would like to develop my social skills and my ability to work well with others, my communication skills, as well as my leadership skills. These soft skills are important when working as a web developer.</p>

            </em>
            <p>My memory is not the best, and my comprehension of technical terms is limited. I have little experience working in groups when it comes to coding and am unsure of the challenges in group work.</p>

               </h4>
            </em>
            <p>I will manage my workload by ensuring I keep to the timebox limits. To ensure that I remember everything I learn, I will re-read my learnings multiple times and also practice repeatedly to drill them into my mind. When it comes to comprehending technical descriptions, I can use google to search up any terms I am unfamiliar with.</p>

            </em>
            <p>
                I will seek help on google where I can search up my questions on stack overflow and other sites with comprehensive documentation such as w3schools. I can also ask other people from my EDA cohort for some help, aswell as the EDA instructors.

                I expect them to be very knowledgable and understanding people who I can easily ask for help.
